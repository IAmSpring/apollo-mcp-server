## MCP authorization not supported

Apollo MCP Server doesn't support [MCP transport-level authorization](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization).

Consequently, when running the MCP Server as a remote service, we recommend running it only in trusted environments and networks, not in public networks.

We plan to support MCP authorization in a future release.
