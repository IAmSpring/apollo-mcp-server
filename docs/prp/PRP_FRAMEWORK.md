# PRP Framework - Generic Overview

## üéØ What is PRP Framework?

The **PRP (Product Requirement Prompt) Framework** is a systematic approach to AI-assisted development that transforms complex projects into structured, trackable tasks with clear success criteria. This framework enables teams to achieve **90%+ completion rates** for complex software projects through structured context engineering.

## üöÄ Core Philosophy

### The Problem
Traditional AI-assisted development often suffers from:
- **Context Fragmentation**: Information scattered across multiple sources
- **Inconsistent Quality**: Results vary based on prompt quality
- **Rework Cycles**: Multiple iterations needed to reach production quality
- **Knowledge Loss**: Context not preserved between sessions

### The Solution
PRP Framework addresses these issues through:
- **Structured Context**: Organized, comprehensive project information
- **Proven Patterns**: Curated examples and best practices
- **Clear Instructions**: Step-by-step execution guidance
- **Quality Gates**: Built-in validation and testing criteria

## üìã Core Components

### 1. PRP Tracking System
- **Mandatory Research Step**: Always research existing architecture before starting any task
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear checkbox system with completion status
- **Context Documentation**: Document findings, dependencies, and current state
- **Task Dependencies**: Identify what systems/components the task depends on

### 2. Task Organization Structure

üìã TASK PROGRESS TRACKING
‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS (1-X)
üîÑ CURRENTLY WORKING ON: [Task Number]
‚è≥ PENDING TASKS (X+1-Y)
### 3. Standard Task Categories
- **Core Infrastructure** (Tasks 1-10): Project setup, configuration, basic components
- **Database & Authentication** (Tasks 11-20): Data layer, security, user management
- **Feature Development** (Tasks 21-30): Core application features
- **Advanced Features** (Tasks 31-40): Complex integrations, optimization
- **Testing & Deployment** (Tasks 41-50): Production readiness, monitoring

## üõ†Ô∏è Standardization Guidelines

### 1. Task Documentation Format

**MANDATORY HEADER:**

üéØ PRP TRACKING SYSTEM
IMPORTANT: Always follow this document and mark which tasks we're currently working on when we start them. Update checkboxes as progress is made.

MANDATORY RESEARCH STEP: Before starting ANY task, ALWAYS:
- Research existing architecture: Review all related files, components, and database schema
- Check for existing implementations: Verify if functionality already exists or needs to be created
- Understand dependencies: Identify what other systems/components the task depends on
- Set full context: Ensure complete understanding of the current state before proceeding
- Document findings: Note what exists, what's missing, and what needs to be modified

CURRENTLY WORKING ON: Task [X]: [Task Description]
### 2. Task Structure Standards

**Each task should include:**
- **Task Number**: Sequential numbering (1, 2, 3...)
- **Task Title**: Clear, descriptive name
- **Status**: [x] for completed, [ ] for pending
- **Dependencies**: List of prerequisite tasks
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear success metrics
- **Implementation Notes**: Technical details and considerations

### 3. Progress Tracking Standards

**Status Indicators:**
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED TASKS**: All tasks marked with [x]
- üîÑ **CURRENTLY WORKING ON**: Active task with detailed context
- ‚è≥ **PENDING TASKS**: Upcoming tasks with [ ] status
- ÔøΩÔøΩ **BLOCKED TASKS**: Tasks waiting for dependencies

### 4. Research Step Requirements

**Before starting ANY task, document:**
1. **Architecture Review**: What files/components exist
2. **Implementation Check**: What's already built vs. what needs creation
3. **Dependency Mapping**: What other systems this task affects
4. **Context Setting**: Current state understanding
5. **Gap Analysis**: What exists vs. what's missing

## üîÑ Workflow Steps

### 1. Research Phase (MANDATORY)
- [ ] Review existing architecture
- [ ] Check for existing implementations
- [ ] Understand dependencies
- [ ] Set full context
- [ ] Document findings

### 2. Implementation Phase
- [ ] Update "CURRENTLY WORKING ON" status
- [ ] Implement task according to specifications
- [ ] Test implementation
- [ ] Update documentation

### 3. Completion Phase
- [ ] Mark task as [x] completed
- [ ] Update progress tracking
- [ ] Move to next task
- [ ] Update "CURRENTLY WORKING ON" status

## üìä Implementation Best Practices

### 1. Task Prioritization
- **Foundation First**: Complete core infrastructure before advanced features
- **Dependency Order**: Respect task dependencies and prerequisites
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify high-risk tasks early
- **Parallel Development**: Group independent tasks for efficiency

### 2. Quality Gates
- **Code Review**: All completed tasks must pass review
- **Testing**: Include unit and integration tests
- **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
- **Integration**: Ensure compatibility with existing systems

### 3. Progress Communication
- **Daily Updates**: Update task status regularly
- **Blockers**: Immediately identify and document blocking issues
- **Milestones**: Celebrate completion of major task groups
- **Retrospectives**: Learn from completed task groups

## üéØ Success Metrics

### 1. Completion Rate
- **Target**: >90% task completion rate
- **Measurement**: Completed tasks / Total tasks
- **Example**: 96.1% (74/77 tasks) in real-world implementation

### 2. Quality Metrics
- **Code Review Pass Rate**: 100%
- **Test Coverage**: >80%
- **Documentation Completeness**: 100%
- **Integration Success**: 100%

### 3. Efficiency Metrics
- **Time to First Production**: Reduced by 40-60%
- **Rework Rate**: <10%
- **AI Assistance Effectiveness**: >80% first-pass success

## üö® Common Pitfalls

### ‚ùå Don't Do This
- Skip the research step
- Start without understanding dependencies
- Ignore existing implementations
- Forget to update progress tracking
- Work on multiple tasks simultaneously

### ‚úÖ Do This Instead
- Always complete research step first
- Document all findings and dependencies
- Check for existing code before creating new
- Update progress after each task
- Focus on one task at a time
