## üîß Areas for Enhancement

### **1. Missing Kubernetes Deployment Details**

**Current State**: Architecture mentions Docker but lacks Kubernetes deployment strategy.

**Recommendations**:
```markdown
## üèóÔ∏è Deployment Architecture

### Kubernetes Deployment Strategy
- Multi-environment support (dev/staging/prod)
- ConfigMap-driven configuration management
- Secret management for Apollo keys and API credentials
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for dynamic scaling
- Network policies for pod-to-pod communication security

### Environment-Specific Configurations
```yaml
# Development Environment
APOLLO_GRAPH_REF=marriott@dev-graph@dev
ENDPOINT=https://dev-api.marriott.com/graphql
SCHEMA_SOURCE=local
OPERATIONS_SOURCE=local

# Staging Environment
APOLLO_GRAPH_REF=marriott@staging-graph@staging
ENDPOINT=https://staging-api.marriott.com/graphql
SCHEMA_SOURCE=remote
OPERATIONS_SOURCE=collection

# Production Environment
APOLLO_GRAPH_REF=marriott@prod-graph@prod
ENDPOINT=https://api.marriott.com/graphql
SCHEMA_SOURCE=remote
OPERATIONS_SOURCE=collection
```

### **2. Security Architecture Gap**

**Current State**: Architecture lacks comprehensive security considerations.

**Recommendations**:
```markdown
## üîí Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- Apollo key management via Kubernetes secrets
- GraphQL API authentication headers configuration
- Network policies for pod-to-pod communication
- RBAC for service account permissions
- TLS termination at ingress level

### Data Protection
- Secrets encryption at rest
- Audit logging for all MCP tool invocations
- Rate limiting for MCP endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration for web frontend

### Network Security
- Pod security policies
- Network policies for ingress/egress
- Service mesh integration (Istio/Linkerd)
- API gateway for external access control
```

### **3. Missing Observability Strategy**

**Current State**: Limited observability and monitoring considerations.

**Recommendations**:
```markdown
## üìä Observability & Monitoring

### Metrics Collection
- Prometheus metrics for MCP tool invocations
- GraphQL operation performance metrics
- Error rates and response time tracking
- Resource utilization monitoring (CPU/memory)
- Custom business metrics for Marriott operations

### Logging Strategy
- Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- Log aggregation via Fluentd/Fluent Bit
- Centralized log storage (ELK stack)
- Log retention policies and compliance
- Real-time log analysis and alerting

### Alerting & Notifications
- High error rates on GraphQL operations
- MCP server availability monitoring
- Schema fetch failures
- Resource exhaustion warnings
- Business-critical operation failures
```

### **4. Operation Management Strategy**

**Current State**: Operations mentioned but strategy not detailed.

**Recommendations**:
```markdown
## üõ†Ô∏è Operation Management

### Operation Sources
1. **Local Files**: `operations/*.graphql` for development and testing
2. **Apollo Collections**: Production-approved operations with versioning
3. **Dynamic Introspection**: AI-generated operations (controlled access)

### Operation Lifecycle Management
- Development: Local `.graphql` files with version control
- Testing: Staging environment validation and performance testing
- Production: Apollo operation collections with approval workflow
- Deprecation: Versioned operation management and migration

### Example Marriott Operations
```graphql
# operations/getReservation.graphql
query GetReservation($confirmationNumber: String!) {
  reservation(confirmationNumber: $confirmationNumber) {
    id
    guestName
    checkIn
    checkOut
    roomType
    status
    totalAmount
  }
}

# operations/searchHotels.graphql
query SearchHotels($location: String!, $checkIn: Date!, $checkOut: Date!) {
  hotels(location: $location, checkIn: $checkIn, checkOut: $checkOut) {
    id
    name
    address
    rating
    availableRooms
    priceRange
  }
}
```
```

### **5. Multi-Agent Integration Strategy**

**Current State**: Basic LLM integration mentioned.

**Recommendations**:
```markdown
## ü§ñ Multi-Agent Integration

### Supported Platforms
- **Claude Desktop**: Direct MCP client integration
- **Cursor**: Built-in MCP support for development
- **ChatGPT**: Custom GPT configuration for customer service
- **LangChain**: MCP tool integration for custom applications
- **Custom Agents**: HTTP transport support for internal tools

### Configuration Examples
```json
// Claude Desktop Configuration
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "marriott-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-streamable-http", 
               "https://mcp.marriott.com/mcp"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}

// Custom Agent Integration
const mcpClient = new MCPClient({
  transport: 'http',
  url: 'https://mcp.marriott.com/mcp',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ${API_KEY}'
  }
});
```
```

### **6. Disaster Recovery & High Availability**

**Current State**: No disaster recovery considerations.

**Recommendations**:
```markdown
## üö® High Availability & Disaster Recovery

### Deployment Strategy
- Multi-zone Kubernetes deployment for geographic redundancy
- Pod disruption budgets for rolling updates
- Health check configuration with appropriate timeouts
- Circuit breaker patterns for external API calls

### Backup & Recovery
- Configuration backup strategy with version control
- Operation collection versioning and rollback capabilities
- Schema version management and compatibility checking
- Automated rollback procedures for failed deployments

### Failover Scenarios
- Apollo Studio connectivity loss (fallback to local schema)
- GraphQL API unavailability (graceful degradation)
- MCP server instance failure (automatic failover)
- Network connectivity issues (retry mechanisms)
```
